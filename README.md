The **Pan Galactic Engineering Framework** (pangalactic) is an
open-architecture, standards-based software framework for engineering

lifecycle management (PLM), computer-aided tools (CAX) integration,
collaborative systems engineering, design, and analysis, and multi-disciplinary
product model capture, integration, synthesis, and transformation.
